# OpenGL_PostApocalyse_Scene
My first OpenGL project. 

For this project, a lot of time was spent on making the scene itself very complete, although all the techniques I used were still relatively young. 

Some of the simple animations in the scene were obtained through mathematical calculations, such as the rippling of the water, the flying fish going back and forth, and so on.

Scenes made in OpenGL can also be made lovely using simple tricks. Here's what the scene looks like:
